# ArchVocab

The ArchVocab ontologies are a work of Leif Isaksen and were available online for a few years at <http://www.archvocab.net/> (the Internet Archive generously keeps [a snapshot of the website home page](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229001934/http://archvocab.net/)).

Last year Leif gently provided me (steko) with a copy of the original RDF files with the hope that I could do something useful with them, perhaps revive the ontology with a new set of stable URIs. So far, that didn't happen, but at least I'm trying to preserve the original work here.

The idea behind ArchVocab is that for most uses it's overkill to build your data structures around huge ontologies like CIDOC CRM, especially for managing relatively simple data from archaeological excavations. ArchVocab acts as a thin layer of homogeneization for various ontologies related to space, time and relationship between entities, so that you can use familiar predicates without worrying about a bajillion different ontologies.

## I like ArchVocab!

If you do, great ðŸŽ‰

Get in touch and let's see if we can do something with ArchVocab. It could be putting it again online, asking for help from the [LOV folks](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/about). It could be upgrading the mapping towards newer, better ontologies while keeping ArchVocab terms intact. Or do something entirely new, who knows.
